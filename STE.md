**Character Biography:**
Thor Odinson is a superhero appearing in Marvel Series. The character, which is based on the Norse deity of the same name, is the Asgardian god of thunder who possesses the enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, which grants him the ability to fly and manipulate weather amongst his other superhuman attributes.
 Unlike his comic book version, however, MCU Thor has no superhero "alter ego".

**Strenghts and Abilities:**
Thor's strength, endurance, and quest for battle are far greater than his Asgardian brethren. The mighty Thor wields an enchanted Uru hammer, Mjolnir, and is master of thunder and lightning. Thor's Powers and Abilities: Superhuman strength, speed, endurance & resistance to injury.

**Weaknesses:**
He can be beaten and even killed by something that’s stronger than him, or trickier than him (like magic). He operates on a level between man and Mangog, so tailor the threat to that level and it’s a fight.
